*Axioms - Things assumed true, being consistent and complementary*

## OZWIP Index

Writing is *work in progress*, you may notice some rough edges, incomplete thoughts, reasoning and examples:

* [On Being Alive](on-being-alive.html)
* [On Reality](on-reality.html)
* [On Money](on-money.html)
* [On Mathematics](on-mathematics.html)
* [How to Teleport](how-to-teleport/)

*To my best humble ability and knowledge. -OZ*
